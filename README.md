# Daily-News-Scrapper 🗞️

## Introduction

This is a simple but very powerful scrapper. I have used <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/"> Hindustan Times </a> as my data source and I the scrapper is scrapping the top news from there.
The Project uses <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup 🍲</a> and some basic pythonic code to fuel itself with the scrapped data.
The streamlit app can be viewed from <a href="https://daily-news-scrapper.streamlit.app/">here</a>

For me it is a stepping stone to move out of the tutorial hell 😈. Maybe this will further motivate someone and will help them too
## Tech Used
<ul>
  <li>Python 🐍</li>
  <li>Streamlit 🚀</li>
  <li> Beautiful Soup 🍲</li>
</ul>

## Future 🔮
I will try to update this project at regular intervals and will try to implement whatever I learned 🤗.

## How to run this on local
Sorry, I am not telling that you need to find that yourself. 
For <b> recruiters you can view it from the <a href="https://daily-news-scrapper.streamlit.app/">link</a> (😉😉)

<b> What you have to search 🔍? </b>
1. How to create a virtual environment in python (The most important step)
2. Learn beautiful soup from any tutorial or maybe docs (personally, I learnt it from docs actually beacuse they stick with you)
3. Go to streamlit docs. (Do it...)
4. Deploying on streamlit is too easy guys! trust me

Do share with me all the projects you came up with 😀😀
 

### To the person who just sees this text 
Try to use this as a motivation please and you can fork it and push a PR if you want to add something. Will be very amazing ✨ to see all the ideas and where this simple but elegant project can reach.

# Happy Learning Guys 🤗
