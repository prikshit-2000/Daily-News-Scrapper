# Daily-News-Scrapper 🗞️

## Introduction

This is a simple but very powerful scrapper. I have used <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/"> Hindustan Times </a> as my data source and I the scrapper is scrapping the top news from there.
The Project uses <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup 🍲</a> and some basic pythonic code to fuel itself with the scrapped data.
The streamlit app can be viewed from <a href="https://daily-news-scrapper.streamlit.app/">here</a>

For me it is a stepping stone to move out of the tutorial hell 😈. Maybe this will further motivate someone and will help them too
## Tech Used
<ul>
  <li>Python 🐍</li>

### To the person who just sees this text
